          As a graduate of Technische Universit√§t Berlin with a degree in Computer Science, I have a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical knowledge of computer science. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, and am particularly interested in the intersection of finance and technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I am working at Coinbase. I am excited to use my skills to create a positive impact on the world through technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          In my spare time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field, and am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skills. I am a strong team player and am always willing to collaborate and learn from others.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am excited to connect with other professionals in the field and explore opportunities to make a difference through technology. Feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn!
